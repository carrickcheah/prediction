    DATA QUALITY REPORT SUMMARY
    
    1. DATABASE CONNECTION: SUCCESSFUL
       - MariaDB connection established
       - All required tables accessible
       - Data available up to July 22, 2025
    
    2. DATA VOLUME:
       - 63,083 job order items
       - 6,071 products in master data
       - ~770 transactions in last 90 days
    
    3. KEY FINDINGS:
       - Most parts exhibit intermittent demand (50-95% zero days)
       - Manufacturing operates ~45% of calendar days (weekdays only)
       - High variability in consumption patterns (CV > 1.0 for many parts)
       - Data quality is good (no negative quantities, minimal issues)
    
    4. FORECASTING APPROACH:
       - Implement specialized intermittent demand models
       - Use business day frequency for time series
       - Build ensemble of models for different demand patterns
       - Focus on lead time prediction for procurement
    
    5. NEXT STEPS:
       - Implement lag features and rolling statistics
       - Build baseline moving average model
       - Create intermittent demand indicators
       - Develop Excel reporting for business users
