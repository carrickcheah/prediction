INVENTORY FORECASTING RECOMMENDATIONS
==================================================
Generated: 2025-08-04 12:30:36.177224

1. INTERMITTENT DEMAND: Most parts show intermittent demand patterns (>50% zero days)
   - Use Croston's method or similar for intermittent demand forecasting
   - Consider zero-inflated models for parts with very high zero percentages

2. DATA FREQUENCY: Manufacturing occurs on ~40 days out of 90 (weekdays only)
   - Use business day frequency instead of calendar days
   - Implement holiday calendar for better predictions

3. SHORT HISTORY: Many parts have limited historical data
   - Use hierarchical forecasting to share information across similar parts
   - Implement transfer learning from parts with more history

4. HIGH VARIABILITY: Several parts show CV > 1.0 (lumpy demand)
   - Use safety stock calculations with higher service levels
   - Consider ensemble methods combining multiple models

5. FEATURE ENGINEERING PRIORITIES:
   - Implement zero run length features
   - Add time since last demand feature
   - Create demand concentration indicators
   - Build lead time features from purchase orders
