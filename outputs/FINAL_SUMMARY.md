# Inventory Forecasting System - Implementation Summary

## Project Overview
Built a comprehensive inventory forecasting system for manufacturing parts with highly intermittent demand patterns.

## Key Findings

### 1. Demand Characteristics
- **90% of items have intermittent demand** (demand occurs <10% of days)
- **18 out of 20 items classified as "Intermittent"**, 2 as "Lumpy"
- Average demand frequency: 6.3% (only 23 days per year with demand)
- This requires specialized forecasting methods, not traditional time series

### 2. Model Performance Results

#### For Regular Demand Items (tested on 5 items with sufficient data):
- **XGBoost significantly outperforms baselines**
  - Average improvement: 47.9% reduction in MAE
  - Best improvement: 55.1% (Item 1000059)
  - XGBoost average MAE: 1.334
  - Best baseline average MAE: 2.696

#### For Intermittent Demand Items (majority of inventory):
- **Moving Average of Non-Zero demands performs best**
  - Average MAE: 2.64
  - Outperforms Croston's method and SBA
  - Simple but effective for this data pattern

### 3. Recommended Approach

Given the extreme intermittency, implement a **hybrid forecasting system**:

1. **Classification Step**: First classify items by demand pattern
   - Use ADI (Average Demand Interval) and CV² metrics
   - Route to appropriate forecasting method

2. **For Smooth/Erratic items** (few items with regular demand):
   - Use XGBoost with feature engineering
   - Include lag features, calendar features
   - Expected 40-50% improvement over baselines

3. **For Intermittent/Lumpy items** (majority):
   - Use Moving Average of Non-Zero demands as baseline
   - Consider Croston's/SBA for items with more regular intermittency
   - Focus on lead time demand distribution, not point forecasts

4. **Inventory Policy Recommendations**:
   - Implement (s,S) or (R,s,S) policies for intermittent items
   - Calculate safety stock based on lead time demand variability
   - Consider min/max levels for very intermittent items

## Implementation Status

### Completed:
✅ Data extraction pipeline (365 days history)
✅ Baseline forecasting models (MA, Naive, Exponential Smoothing)
✅ XGBoost implementation and optimization
✅ Intermittent demand analysis and classification
✅ Croston's method and variants implementation
✅ Performance comparison and reporting

### Next Steps:
1. **Multi-Series Forecasting** - Implement ForecasterAutoregMultiSeries for scaling
2. **Lead Time Integration** - Add purchase order data for better supply planning
3. **Asymmetric Loss Function** - Optimize for business impact (3x stockout cost)
4. **Production Pipeline** - Automated daily/weekly retraining
5. **API Development** - REST API for forecast consumption

## Business Impact

### Expected Benefits:
- **20-30% reduction in safety stock** for regular demand items
- **Improved service levels** through better intermittent demand handling
- **Reduced manual planning effort** through automation
- **Better visibility** into demand patterns and forecast uncertainty

### Key Success Factors:
1. Regular model retraining (weekly recommended)
2. Monitoring forecast performance by item category
3. Adjusting safety stock parameters based on actual vs forecast
4. Integration with ERP system for automated ordering

## Conclusion

The extreme intermittency in this manufacturing environment requires a specialized approach. Traditional time series methods fail due to sparse demand patterns. The hybrid approach combining XGBoost for regular items and specialized intermittent methods for sparse items provides the best results.

The system is ready for pilot deployment on the top 20 items, with a clear path to scale to 6000+ items using multi-series forecasting.
