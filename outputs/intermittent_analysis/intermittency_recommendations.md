# Intermittent Demand Analysis and Recommendations
Generated on: 2025-08-02 14:41:32

## Summary Statistics
- Total items analyzed: 20
- Average demand frequency: 15.9%
- Items with <10% demand frequency: 8

## Demand Pattern Classification
- Intermittent: 18 items (90.0%)
- Lumpy: 2 items (10.0%)

## Recommended Forecasting Methods by Pattern

### Lumpy Demand (High intermittency, High variability)
Items: 1003053, 1003646
Recommended methods:
- Croston's method or SBA (Syntetos-Boylan Approximation)
- TSB (Teunter-Syntetos-Babai) method
- Machine learning with zero-inflated models

### Intermittent Demand (High intermittency, Low variability)
Items: 1000045, 1003434, 1003435, 1003436, 1003501, 1003437, 1003271, 1003380, 1003502, 1000059, 1003432, 1003379, 1003483, 1003270, 1003894, 1003895, 1003739, 1003740
Recommended methods:
- Croston's method
- Simple exponential smoothing on non-zero demands

### Erratic Demand (Low intermittency, High variability)
Items: 
Recommended methods:
- Standard time series methods with robust estimators
- XGBoost with appropriate features

### Smooth Demand (Low intermittency, Low variability)
Items: 
Recommended methods:
- Traditional time series (ARIMA, ETS)
- XGBoost/Machine Learning

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **For Lumpy/Intermittent items (majority of inventory):**
   - Implement Croston's method or TSB as baseline
   - Use separate forecasts for demand occurrence and demand size
   - Consider lead time demand distribution instead of point forecasts

2. **For XGBoost/ML approaches:**
   - Use zero-inflated models (forecast P(demand>0) separately)
   - Include features like 'days since last demand'
   - Consider aggregating to weekly/monthly for more stable patterns

3. **For all items:**
   - Focus on service level rather than forecast accuracy
   - Implement safety stock based on lead time demand variability
   - Consider min/max inventory policies for very intermittent items
