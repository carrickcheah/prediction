### 2025-08-01 - Advanced ML Techniques Integration from Reference Repositories
- **Reference Material Analysis**:
  - Analyzed `/reference/feature-engineering-for-time-series-forecasting` course
  - Studied `/reference/forecasting-with-machine-learning` materials
  - Identified 10 key improvements for inventory forecasting system
- **Major Technical Decisions**:
  - Adopted Multi-Series forecasting approach using `skforecast` library
  - Will use `ForecasterAutoregMultiSeries` to handle 6000+ parts with single model
  - Chose ensemble approach: recursive for short horizons, direct for long horizons
  - Decided on custom asymmetric loss function (stockouts cost 3x overstock)
- **Key Techniques Identified**:
  - **Intermittent Demand Handling**: Zero run lengths, time since last demand
  - **Hierarchical Features**: Product families, categories for shared learning
  - **Dynamic Lead Time Learning**: Calculate from actual purchase history
  - **Cyclical Encoding**: Better than one-hot for seasonal features
  - **Change Point Detection**: Identify demand pattern shifts
  - **Production Monitoring**: Track model drift and trigger retraining
- **Advanced Features to Implement**:
  - Demand volatility indicators (coefficient of variation)
  - Interaction features (weekend × lag, holiday × season)
  - Target encoding for categorical variables
  - STL decomposition for outlier detection
  - Multi-horizon ensemble predictions
- **Validation Strategy**:
  - Time series cross-validation with `TimeSeriesFold`
  - Backtesting without data leakage
  - Custom inventory-specific metrics
  - Expanding window validation
- **Documentation Updates**:
  - Enhanced TODO.md with multi-series approach and advanced features
  - Updated WORKFLOW.md with ensemble forecasting and monitoring
  - Added production monitoring and model drift detection workflows

### 2025-08-01 - Inventory Forecasting System Planning & Database Analysis
- **Project Pivot**:
  - Shifted focus from job scheduling to inventory forecasting system
  - Identified critical business need: preventing stockouts and reducing excess inventory
  - Current pain points: manual checking, human errors, forgotten updates
- **Database Analysis**:
  - Analyzed MariaDB database structure for prediction suitability
  - Identified 7 key tables for inventory forecasting:
    - `tbl_sorder_item` + `tbl_sorder_txn` (sales demand)
    - `tbl_porder_item` + `tbl_porder_txn` (purchase supply)
    - `tbl_jo_item` + `tbl_jo_txn` (manufacturing consumption)
    - `tbl_product_code` (product master data)
  - Discovered unreliable inventory data - decided to focus on transaction flow instead
  - Found 8,766 total items with 6,588 unique stock codes
- **Technical Decisions**:
  - Chose part consumption approach over sales-based prediction
  - Focus on actual usage patterns rather than theoretical BOM explosions
  - Start with top 20 high-volume parts, scale to 6000+ later
  - Selected XGBoost as primary ML model for predictions
  - Will use simple moving averages as baseline for comparison
- **Key SQL Queries Developed**:
  - Top products by volume and revenue analysis
  - Part consumption time series extraction
  - Purchase order lead time calculation
  - Daily consumption pattern analysis
- **Architecture Planning**:
  - Designed 4-phase implementation plan
  - Created data flow architecture from database to reports
  - Planned daily automated workflow (6 AM execution)
  - Defined success metrics: 50% stockout reduction, 30% inventory reduction
- **Documentation Created**:
  - `WORKFLOW.md`: Complete system workflow and architecture
  - `TODO.md`: Detailed phased implementation plan with checkboxes
  - Updated project direction from scheduling to inventory forecasting

### 2025-07-23 - Database Optimization & Frontend Enhancement
- **Database Performance Optimization**:
  - Identified slow "LOAD ALL JOBS FROM DATABASE" button performance (5-15 seconds)
  - Created `app/sql/create_indexes.sql` with comprehensive index optimization
  - Added composite indexes for `tbl_jo_txn` and `tbl_jo_process` tables
  - Implemented covering indexes to reduce I/O operations
  - Created `app/sql/README.md` with installation and maintenance instructions
  - Expected performance improvement: 80-95% faster (from 5-15s to 0.3-1s)
  - Successfully applied indexes to production database
- **Frontend UI Restructuring**:
  - Added tabbed navigation to separate Dashboard, Jobs Chart, and Machine Chart views
  - Implemented `ScheduleContext` for sharing schedule data between components
  - Created `JobsChart.tsx` component:
    - Job-centric Gantt view with families on Y-axis
    - Time range selector (7, 14, 30, 60 days)
    - Color-coded jobs (green: on-time, purple: medium priority, red: high priority)
    - Current time indicator and hover tooltips
  - Created `MachineChart.tsx` component:
    - Resource-centric view showing machine utilization
    - Machine names with utilization percentages
    - Similar time range and color coding
    - Machine utilization summary statistics
  - Modified `ScheduleForm.tsx`:
    - Removed default 20 jobs input field
    - Removed 'GENERATE SAMPLE' button
    - Removed 'LOAD FROM FILE' button
    - Added auto-load functionality on component mount
    - Changed to 'Refresh Jobs' button for manual reload
- **Key Improvements**:
  - Cleaner, more focused UI with dedicated views for different perspectives
  - Significantly faster job loading from database
  - Better user experience with automatic job loading
  - Maintained all existing functionality while improving usability
